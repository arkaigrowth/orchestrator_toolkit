# Phase 6 & 7 Migration Complete

## Summary of Changes

This document summarizes the implementation of Phase 6 & 7 of the PLAN/SPEC/EXECUTE migration for the Orchestrator Toolkit v2.0.

### Phase 6: Makefile Targets ✅

Created `Makefile` with convenient shortcuts:
- `make plan TITLE="..."` - Create a new PLAN
- `make spec PLAN=P-XXX TITLE="..."` - Create a SPEC for a PLAN
- `make exec SPEC=S-XXX` - Execute a SPEC
- `make new TEXT="..."` - Run any otk-new command
- `make help` - Show usage information

### Phase 7: Documentation Updates ✅

#### 1. Updated pyproject.toml Entry Points
Added new unified CLI commands:
- `otk` - Main CLI entry point with subcommands
- `otk-new` - Natural language command interface
- `otk-plan-new` - Direct PLAN creation
- `otk-spec-new` - Direct SPEC creation
- `otk-exec` - Direct SPEC execution

Maintained backward compatibility with legacy commands:
- `task-new`, `plan-new`, `orchestrator-once`, `plan-summarize`

#### 2. Created Shell Scripts in .claude/commands/
- `plan.sh` - Quick PLAN creation wrapper
- `spec.sh` - Quick SPEC creation wrapper
- `exec.sh` - Quick execution wrapper
- `otk.sh` - General OTK command wrapper

All scripts are executable and provide convenient shortcuts for Claude Code.

#### 3. Updated .claude/CLAUDE.md
Transformed from v1.0 to v2.0 documentation:
- Added comprehensive command reference
- Documented PLAN→SPEC→EXECUTE workflow
- Included Makefile shortcuts
- Added best practices and examples
- Maintained backward compatibility notes

#### 4. Created Templates
- Created `.claude/templates/spec.md` - Template for SPEC files with:
  - Objective and context sections
  - Technical design and approach
  - Implementation steps checklist
  - Acceptance criteria
  - Risk assessment
  - Proper metadata headers

### Implementation Details

#### Natural Language Processing
The `otk-new` command uses the existing `phrase_router` to intelligently parse commands:
- Recognizes "plan", "spec", and "execute" keywords
- Extracts titles and IDs from natural language
- Supports quoted and unquoted arguments
- Falls back gracefully for ambiguous input

#### ULID-Based IDs
All new entities use ULID (Universally Unique Lexicographically Sortable Identifier):
- Format: `TYPE-YYYYMMDD-ULID-slug`
- Example: `PLAN-20251013-01K7A2-test-makefile-creation`
- Benefits: Sortable, unique, human-readable

#### Directory Structure
```
ai_docs/
├── plans/         # PLAN documents (P-[ULID].md)
├── specs/         # SPEC documents (S-[ULID].md)
├── exec_logs/     # Execution logs (S-[ULID]-exec-*.md)
└── tasks/         # Legacy task files (backward compat)
```

### Testing Results
All components tested successfully:
- ✅ Makefile targets working
- ✅ otk-new natural language processing
- ✅ Shell scripts executable and functional
- ✅ Templates generating correctly
- ✅ ULID-based ID generation
- ✅ Cross-linking between PLAN→SPEC→EXECUTE

### Backward Compatibility
Maintained full compatibility with v1.0:
- Legacy commands still available
- Old task/plan files untouched
- Existing workflows continue to function
- Gradual migration path available

### Next Steps
The PLAN/SPEC/EXECUTE system is now fully operational. Users can:
1. Create PLANs for high-level objectives
2. Break PLANs into detailed SPECs
3. Track execution with timestamped logs
4. Use natural language or direct commands
5. Leverage Makefile for quick operations

The system is ready for production use.
