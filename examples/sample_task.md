## Goal
Implement JWT-based authentication system for the REST API with refresh token support.

## Notes
- Use RS256 algorithm for signing tokens
- Access tokens expire in 15 minutes
- Refresh tokens expire in 7 days
- Store refresh tokens in secure HTTP-only cookies
- Implement token revocation mechanism
- Add rate limiting on auth endpoints

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Users can login with email/password
- [ ] System returns access and refresh tokens
- [ ] Tokens can be refreshed before expiry
- [ ] Logout invalidates refresh token
- [ ] Protected endpoints validate JWT tokens
- [ ] Failed auth attempts are rate limited
