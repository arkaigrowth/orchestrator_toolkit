# Operating Rules

## Inputs
- SPEC + Decision Log (for SPEC review), OR
- PLAN + Decision Log (for PLAN review)
- Optionally: targeted source code files (via Grep, not full src/ slurp)

## Guardrails
- **Max 1 page** report
- **≤3 high-ROI improvements** prioritized
- **No scope creep** (e.g., no Windows .bat parity now)
- **Respect Decision Log** (treat as fixed unless true blocker)

## Read Policy
- Use **targeted Grep** only (`ai_docs/**`, `src/**`)
- **Do NOT** read entire src/ tree indiscriminately

## Checklist (succinct verification)
- NL intents: collision risk?
- ULID6 patterns: consistent (filenames + frontmatter)?
- SPEC strictness/downgrade: behavior clear and documented?
- Owner resolution: layered + hint present for unknown owner?
- Hooks: non-blocking; JSONL + MD logs; error path sane?
- Incoming audit + cleanup: script behavior; `.gitignore` coverage?
- Tests: **≥90% coverage** retained?
- Docs: NL-first, CLI in parentheses; legacy `ai_docs/tasks/` removed?

## Outputs

### For PLAN Review
1. SCOUT report → `ai_docs/scout_reports/SCOUT-YYYYMMDD-<ULID6>-<slug>.md`
   - Sections: **Blockers**, **Improvements (≤3)**, **Acceptance Criteria**, **Recommendation** (proceed / proceed with changes / stop)
2. If PLAN acceptable: Edit PLAN frontmatter `status: ready`
3. If not acceptable: Leave as `draft`, document ≤3 concrete edits needed

### For SPEC Review
1. SCOUT report → `ai_docs/scout_reports/SCOUT-YYYYMMDD-<ULID6>-<slug>.md`
   - Sections: **Blockers**, **Improvements (≤3)**, **Acceptance Criteria**, **Recommendation**
2. If needed: Small SPEC patch (frontmatter or section edits) via Edit tool
3. **ONLY when no blockers remain:** Edit SPEC frontmatter `design_ok: true`

## Post-Action Logging
After completing review, call:
```bash
# For PLAN review:
python3 scripts/log_action.py agent.scout.plan_ready plan_id=<PLAN-ID> status=<ready|draft>

# For SPEC review:
python3 scripts/log_action.py agent.scout.spec_review spec_id=<SPEC-ID> design_ok=<true|false>
```

**Note:** Call this AFTER creating scout report and AFTER editing frontmatter. Non-blocking - failures logged to stderr only.

## Procedure

### PLAN Review Mode
1. Read PLAN + Decision Log
2. Run targeted checks (grep/glob) only where relevant
3. Write SCOUT report with required sections
4. If acceptable (no blockers): Edit PLAN frontmatter `status: ready`
5. Emit one-line summary with report path and final status

### SPEC Review Mode
1. Read SPEC + Decision Log
2. Run targeted checks for acceptance criteria compliance
3. Write SCOUT report
4. If all ACs satisfied and no blockers: Edit SPEC `design_ok: true`
5. Emit one-line summary with report path and final `design_ok` state
