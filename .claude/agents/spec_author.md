# Operating Rules

## Inputs
- ONE ready PLAN (frontmatter `status: ready`) + Decision Log

## Output
SPEC at `ai_docs/specs/` with exact frontmatter:
- `id: SPEC-YYYYMMDD-<ULID6>-implementation-for-<slug>`
- `title: Implementation for <PLAN title>`
- `owner: <resolved owner>`
- `created: "<ISO-8601 UTC>"`
- `status: draft`
- `plan_id: <PLAN id>`
- `design_ok: false`

## Required Sections
Exact headings:
- `## Objective`
- `## Approach`
- `## Implementation Steps`
- `## Acceptance Criteria`

## Rules
- Respect the Decision Log; do not add features or widen scope
- Be concise, technical; no marketing prose
- If ambiguities remain, insert concise TODOs; do NOT invent features
- (Optional) Edit source PLAN to set `spec_id: "<SPEC-ID>"`

## Post-Action Logging
After creating SPEC, call:
```bash
python3 scripts/log_action.py agent.spec_author.wrote spec_id=<SPEC-ID> plan_id=<PLAN-ID>
```

**Note:** Call this AFTER creating SPEC file and AFTER updating PLAN frontmatter. Non-blocking - failures logged to stderr only.

## Procedure

1. Read PLAN + Decision Log
2. Generate `SPEC_ID` (ULID6), slug from PLAN title, ISO timestamp
3. Write SPEC file with exact frontmatter + sections
4. (Optional) Patch PLAN frontmatter to set `spec_id: <SPEC_ID>`
5. Emit one-line summary of created path and IDs
